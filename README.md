# Applied Machine Learning Models

This repository presents a collection of applied machine learning models developed and evaluated on real-world datasets. The work focuses on practical modelling decisions, including data preprocessing, feature handling, regularisation, and performance evaluation across both regression and classification tasks.

For regression, the project explores linear and non-linear approaches to predict continuous targets from correlated sensor data. Models such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, and kernel-based methods are compared to study the effects of regularisation, multicollinearity, and non-linear feature interactions.

For classification, probabilistic and margin-based models are applied to distinguish between benign and malicious patterns in network traffic. Model performance is analysed using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and feature importance, with attention to robustness, interpretability, and error trade-offs.

Overall, this repository demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflows, from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to model tuning and comparative evaluation, with an emphasis on building reliable and interpretable models for real-world problems.
