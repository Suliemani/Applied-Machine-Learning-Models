# Applied-Machine-Learning-Models
Applied machine learning models for regression and classification on real-world datasets. The project explores linear, regularised, and kernel-based methods for prediction and decision-making, with a focus on preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, and robustness across sensor data and network traffic analysis.
